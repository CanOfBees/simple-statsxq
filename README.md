# simple-statsxq

Inspired by Tom MacWright's (@tmcw) simple-statistics project for JavaScript [simple-statistics](https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics) project. The goal of this module is to provide a basic set of statistical functions for doing data analysis in XQuery 3.1.

Functions are intended to be implementation agnostic. 

Unit tests use the [unit testing module](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Unit_Module) of [BaseX](http://basex.org/).
